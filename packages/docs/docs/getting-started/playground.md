# Playground

Want to try Nadle without installing anything? You can experiment with Nadle directly
in your browser using our [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/nam-hle/nadle/tree/main/packages/examples/basic?file=package.json) integration.

## What's in the Playground?

The demo project includes:

1. A basic TypeScript project setup
2. Pre-configured `nadle.config.ts`
3. Example tasks for common scenarios
4. Interactive terminal to run commands

## Example Tasks to Try

Once the demo loads, try these commands in the terminal:

```bash
# List all available tasks
nadle --list

# Show the current resolved configuration
nadle --show-config

# Run the hello task
nadle hello
```

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different configurations!
